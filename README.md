# Command Line Utilities

This has a collection of command line utilities:
* collatz - can print the collatz sequence
* divisors - prints the divisors of any number
* primes - can check if a number is a prime, print primes within a range of values, or print primes in a range by their index.  
  Most operations are very fast, just printing them by index is slow.  It is limited to checking integers under 2^64.
